# AIRBNB HOTEL BOOKING ANALYSIS

### Airbnb Price Prediction Project üè†üí∞

## Overview
This project develops a **machine learning regression model** to predict Airbnb listing prices. Pricing an Airbnb property correctly is crucial for hosts and travelers: hosts aim to maximize occupancy and earnings, while travelers want fair and competitive rates. Using historical Airbnb data, the model learns the relationships between listing attributes (e.g., bedrooms, bathrooms, guest ratings) and price, helping property owners make informed pricing decisions.

---

## Problem Statement
Airbnb enables property owners to rent homes or apartments to travelers. A key challenge for hosts is setting the right price, which depends on factors like number of bedrooms and bathrooms, cleanliness, listing accuracy, and communication quality with guests.
